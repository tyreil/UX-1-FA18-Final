# UX 1 Final 
## Part One - Heuristic Evaluation
Choose a unique app that no one else has selected yet from your section of UX 1, and sign up for it through [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ro0M7ucmMkKDUlOn_015SXwmw00CK6N2K1V_zLxJMO4/edit?usp=sharing).

Then, get ready to dive deep: you’ll design thoughtful solutions to its top usability issues. You’ll also build a compelling case study showing employers the research and strategy behind your improved design.

Here are some excellent examples of UX case studies like the one you’ll create:
* [Meetup](https://uxdesign.cc/meetup-a-usability-case-study-e909c33f1e3e)
* [Instagram](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-wanted-to-see-how-far-i-could-push-myself-creatively-so-i-redesigned-instagram-1ff99f28fa8b)
* [London By Bike](http://simonpan.com/work/bikes-case-study/)
* [Fitbit](https://uxdesign.cc/fitbit-a-usability-case-study-b23e4c539c3c)

If you’re having trouble finding a challenging user flow to tackle, look for popular apps with low ratings in the app store. What usability issues do user complaints describe? Users won’t touch an app that’s difficult to navigate, no matter how beautiful the design. What are the biggest pain points and blockers users run into? You’ll identify the top issues that users face (and that your design will aim to resolve).

Start by downloading the app and going through all possible actions, focusing on key tasks users would want/need to take. Look for areas of confusion, inefficiency, and other usability issues, referring to [Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

### Examples of what to look out for:
* Is the navigation clear?
* How easy is it to complete tasks?
* Is content organized effectively?
* Are frequently used buttons/links conveniently located?
* Are links/features clearly accessible?
* Is it easy to find information/support?

### Submission - Part One
Identify 5 usability issues with the app's existing design. Create a Medium post with brief write-up relating usability heuristics to the issues you have identified, along with screenshots with annotations for reference.


## Part Two - User Flows
Effective UX is more than the sum of its parts—designers must consider how separate pages flow together and move users through the app. Map how users work through specific tasks on your chosen app, then propose your own improved user flow.
Here is some example user flows for an app like Venmo:

* Sending payment
* Requesting payment
* Reminding people to pay
* Transferring balance to bank
* Adding a friend

Brainstorm all possible actions a user can take on your chosen app. Identify the most important actions, then document the steps users follow to complete those tasks. Once you understand the key existing user flows, propose improved user flows addressing the problematic areas you found in your heuristic evaluation. Ask yourself: Why do people use this app, what features are most important to them, and what problems do they need to be solved? How does the existing design help or hinder users?

### Submission - Part Two
Create your improved users flows using [37signals Shorthand for User Flows in your sketchbooks.](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows) Create a section called "User flows" within your medium post. Write supporting copy that explains why you selected those specific user flows, and how your newly proposed user flows are an improvement.

## Part Three - Redesign

Begin by wireframing a variety of solutions to the usability issues you identified with your app. These are simple, communicative, and quickly drawn. The goal is to come up with conceptual structures, not final designs. 
Once you've completed your wireframes, you can begin to create your layouts in Sketch, utilizing a brand elements and styles as necessary to complete your redesigned interface. 
If there is a "what you see", within the previous step's user flows, then there is a strong likelihood that you will need to create a layout for it.
Note: You are not redesigning the whole app. You are redesigning the usability issues that you have identified in the previous steps. ("Heuristic Evaluation" & "Map User Flows")

### Submission - Part Three

Update your Medium link with your redesigns, and write-up your design rationale.
